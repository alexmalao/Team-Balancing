## ====== Team-Balancing ======

**These scripts are deprecated. Find the python equivalent [here](https://github.com/alexmalao/League-Team-Maker)**

Pseudo optimal balancing of teams of 5 based on relative mmr.

Allows support for:
- any amount of entrants perfectly divisible by 5
- total duo queue partners equal to one or two pairs per team
- diverse skill range

Input data should be similar to sample input data.

All instructions are set in the TODO: notes.

mmr.tier can be updated to set up any acceptable mmr ranges.
